    <p> A GitHub Repository basically offers storage for a project's different files, documents, and code. You can use branches to have separate versions of code that can can be worked on without affecting the main project, helping to facilitate experimentation and changes. 
      Commits are used to save changes to the GitHub Respository. This website was made by creating a repository on GitHub, and then commiting an HTML file. Afterwards, the main branch was deployed and the website went live.
