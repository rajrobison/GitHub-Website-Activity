    <p> A GitHub Repository basically offers storage for a project's different files, documents, and code. You can use branches to have separate versions of code that can can be worked on without affecting the main project, helping to facilitate experimentation and changes. 
      Commits are used to save changes to the GitHub Respository. This website was made by creating a repository on GitHub, and then commiting an HTML file. Afterwards, the main branch was deployed and the website went live.

      I am currently experimenting with generative AI. Here is a AI generated description of the Texas A&M Aggies Football Team: The Texas A&M Aggies football team represents Texas A&M University in NCAA Division I FBS competition and is a member of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). Based in College Station, the Aggies play their home games at Kyle Field, one of the largest stadiums in the country with a capacity of over 102,000 fans. Known for their rich traditions and passionate fan base, the Aggies embody the spirit of the “12th Man,” a century-old symbol of unity and readiness that reflects the unwavering support of the student body and alumni. The team’s colors, maroon and white, are proudly displayed across campus and throughout gamedays marked by Yell Leaders, the Fightin’ Texas Aggie Band, and a deeply rooted culture of loyalty and pride. Over its storied history, Texas A&M has claimed three national championships and multiple conference titles, establishing itself as one of college football’s most tradition-rich and respected programs.
